# Introduction

<!-- SOMEWHERE PROMINANT: researchers and policymakers have ignored student lists -->

Colleges and universities identify prospective students by purchasing "student lists" from College Board, ACT, and other vendors. Student lists contain the contact information of prospective students that meet the criteria (e.g., test score range, high school GPA, zip codes) specified in a student list purchase. Sometimes referred to as "names," student lists are a fundamental input for undergraduate recruiting "campaigns," which target individual prospects by mail, email, and on social media. 

__Student outcomes__. Recent research suggests that student lists have surprisingly large effects on college access -- and in turn degree completion -- for millions of students each year. @RN4739 compared SAT test-takers who opted into the College Board Student Search Service -- allowing accredited institutions to "licence" their contact information -- and test-takers who opted out, after controlling for covariates. Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) reproduces the main results. For students with the same values of SAT score, parental education, race/ethnicity, sex, high school graduation year, and who attended the same high school, 41.1\% of students who participated in Search attended a 4-year college compared to 32.8\% of students who opted out, representing an 8.3 (`=41.1-32.8`) percentage point difference and a 25.3 (`=(41.1-32.8)/32.8`) percent change in the relative probability of attending a 4-year college (for a similar analysis of ACT's Educational Opportunity Service (EOS) see @RN4752). 

<!-- 
Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) shows that the percent change in the relative probability of attending a 4-year institution associated with participating in Search was higher for students who identified as Black (24.\5%`=(39.6-31.8)/31.8`), Latinx (34.4\%), American Indian or Alaska Native (23.8\%), and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (26.1\%) than it was for students who identified as White (21.6\%) or Asian (15.2\%)
-->

Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) shows that participating in Search was associated with a larger percent change in the probability of attending a 4-year institution for students who identified as Black (24.5\%`=(39.6-31.8)/31.8`), Latinx (34.4\%), American Indian or Alaska Native (23.8\%), and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (26.1\%) than it was for students who identified as White (21.6\%) or Asian (15.2\%). Similarly, the percent change in the probability of attending a four-year college was higher for students whose parents did not attend college (40.6\%) than it was for students whose parents had a BA (18.9\%).

Given that the probability of graduating is affected by which institution a student attends [e.g., @RN2261; @RN1494], student lists may also affect degree completion through their effect on initial postsecondary institution. @RN4739 analyzed the four-year BA degree completion rates of SAT test-takers from the 2015 and 2016 high school graduation cohorts. Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) shows that 20.6\% of students who participated in Search obtained a BA in four years compared to 15.7\% of students who opted out, representing a 31.2\% (`=(20.6-15.7)/15.7`) increase in the relative probability of graduation. Furthermore, the relative increase in the probability of obtaining a BA was higher for Black (40.3\%), Hispanic (43.3\%), and Native American/Alaska Native students (48.3\%) than it was for White (27.9\%) and Asian (28.2\%) students. The relative increase was also higher for students whose parents did not attend college (50.0\%) than it was for students whose parents had a BA (25.3\%).

How could student lists -- which have been ignored by policymakers and researchers for decades -- be so important for college access in the U.S.? 

Student lists play an essential role in the college access process because the U.S. higher education market is structured as a national voucher system that depends on providers to go out and find the students.

The answer begins with understanding the market for higher education and the role played by federal financial aid. 
-->


__The U.S. market for higher education__. Although the results above cannot be considered causal, the magnitude of these findings are huge even after including a strong set of control variables. How could student lists be so important for college access in the U.S.? The answer lies in the structure of the higher education market and the role played by federal financial aid.

U.S higher education is a market-based system consisting of a mix of providers -- public, private non-profit, for-profit -- in which the federal government takes a "steer don't row" approach, using subsidies and regulations to encourage providers to achieve government goals around college access and degree completion. Aside from research funding, the federal government subsidizes higher education primarily by providing Title IV grants and loans to students. These funds follow students to whichever Title IV postsecondary institutions they attend, thereby creating a national voucher system. The largest revenue source for most Title IV institutions is tuition, which is composed of household savings and grants and loans, including federal financial aid. Thus, postsecondary institutions have an incentive to enroll students who can afford the cost of attendance and the Title IV financial aid system creates an incentive to enroll students who are eligible for federal grants and loans.

What is the role of student lists in the US higher education market? Student lists are a match-making intermediary that connects institutions -- which must enroll students to survive -- to prospective students -- who want to acquire human capital. Beyond the basic requirement of survival, universities pursue some set of broad enrollment goals (e.g., academic profile, racial diversity, tuition revenue), while also meeting the needs of various campus constituencies (e.g., College of Engineering needs majors, marching band needs players) [@RN3519]. Universities cannot realize these goals solely from prospects who find the university on their own; they must find desirable prospects who can be convinced to enroll. However, universities don't know who these prospects are, where they are, or how to contact them. Student lists overcome the problem faced by universities, providing the contact information of prospects who satisfy criteria specified by the university. 

From the perspective of prospective students facing the problem of not knowing all of their college options, student lists enable interested universities to contact them. In practice, student list products are oriented to university enrollment goals rather than student opportunity goals because universities are the customers that pay for lists. 

<!-- CUT STUFF ABOVE/BELOW
other universities followed suit because this became what "legitimate" universities do
-->
__The market for student list data__. For the past 50 years, the college access process has substantially depended on the SAT/ACT college entrance exam. Once leading public and private universities adopted the SAT/ACT as an admissions requirement, others followed suit because the test had become a de facto requirement for "legitimate" universities. In turn, high school students who wanted to attend a 4-yr college were compelled to take the SAT or the ACT, creating unparalleled databases of prospective students. College Board created the Student Search Service in 1972 [@belkin2019-studata] -- ACT later created the Educational Opportunity Service -- and the testing organizations have dominated the student list business ever since.

The 21st Century market for student list data has been surprisingly dynamic, marked by advances in technology, new sources of student list data, and entry by for-profit interests. In the 2000s, firms building college search engines (e.g., Scholarships.com) and niche social network platforms (e.g., Zinch) promised greater competition. Since 2010, however, the market became increasingly concentrated because of a surge in acquisitions. Looking forward, the test-optional movement threatens to de-institutionalize the SAT/ACT college entrance exam, eroding the coverage of College Board and ACT student list products. Large enrollment management consulting firms -- particularly EAB -- and firms providing software to high schools -- particularly PowerSchool -- are poised to acquire market share ceded by College Board and ACT. These firms have learned to maximize profit by controlling a unique database of prospects and restricting access to institutions that pay for consulting services.


__Policy concerns__. The student list business poses concerns for college access today and in the future. The College Board and ACT student list products, which dominate the market today, systematically exclude underrepresented student populations in two ways. First, only test-takers are included in the underlying student list databases, but test-taking rates differ by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Second, student list products utilize "search filters" (e.g., test score range, GPA, zip-code, intended major) to control which prospects are included/excluded in a student list purchase. Over the past decade, College Board and ACT have added new search filters that enable universities to make "efficient" name buys that target "right fit" prospects. For example, College Board "geodemographic" filters target prospects based on the past behavior of students from their high school and their neighborhood. We argue that search filters that facilitate micro-targeting contribute to systematic exclusion of students from communities color, low-income communities, and rural communities.

Looking forward, the test-optional movement will erode the College Board and ACT student list businesses, creating the unintended consequence of a college access crisis. Although the test-optional movement increases equity in the process of college _admissions_, these exams have been central the broader process of college _access_. A by-product of these exams, student lists are an essential mechanism that connects Title IV institutions to prospective students. In the coming years, the number of college-going students who take the SAT or ACT will fall precipitously, eroding the coverage of College Board and ACT student lists. Without the emergence of viable alternatives, we anticipate a crisis in college access because Title IV institutions will be unable to connect with prospective students. Unfortunately, the for-profit interests positioned to control the market for student list data are even more problematic than College Board and ACT because these firms will funnel prospective students only to universities that have paid for consulting services. 

__Policy solutions__. Policymakers must act quickly to fix systemic inequities in the current system and to avoid a college access crisis born of good intentions. This policy report develops the foundation for a multi-faceted reform agenda. First, policymakers must understand how the student list business works and how it is changing, which are the goals of [The Student List Business] section. Second, [Regulating the Student List Business] considers regulations for student list products, student list suppliers, and student list customers (i.e., universities). Regulation is necessary but not sufficient. The underlying problem is that the student list business is oriented to university enrollment goals rather than equality of opportunity for students. Therefore, the [Public Option] section proposes a student list product based on state administrative data that would avoid the exclusionary practices of private sector products by providing prospect names (those who opt in) to universities for free.

BRIEF PARAGRAPH STATING WHAT SECTION DOES

## The Enrollment Funnel

The "enrollment funnel" -- depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:em-funnel) -- is a conceptual visualization used in the enrollment management industry that describes stages in the process of recruiting students (e.g., prospects, leads, inquiries, applicants, admits, and enrolled students). "Prospects" are all desirable potential students. "Leads" are prospects whose contact information has been obtained. "Inquiries" are prospects that contact your institution and consist of two types: first, inquiries who respond to an initial solicitation  (e.g., email) from the university; and second, "student as first contact" inquiries who reach out to the university on their own, for example, by sending ACT scores to the institution or by taking a "[virtual tour](https://eab.com/products/virtual-tours/)" that records IP address. Applicants consist of inquiries who apply plus "stealth applicants" who do not contact the university before applying.

```{r em-funnel, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "The enrollment funnel", out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics('./../assets/images/enrollment_funnel.png')
```

The enrollment funnel is based on the "marketing funnel," in which "marketers cast a broad net to capture as many leads as possible, and then slowly nurture prospective customers through the purchasing decision, narrowing down these candidates in each stage of the funnel" [@skyword_funnel]. The shape of the enrollment funnel suggests an institution that begins with a large pool of desirable prospects and at each successive stage the funnel narrows to convey the assumption of "melt" (e.g., a subset of inquiries will apply). The practical purpose of the enrollment funnel is to inform interventions that increase the probability of "conversion" from one stage to another [@RN4322]. For example, fnancial aid packages convert admits to enrolled students.

### Lists of Leads

At the top of the enrollment funnel, universities identify "leads" by purchasing "student lists." The sum of purchased leads and student-as-first-contact inquiries (e.g., filled out an online admissions inquiry form) constitutes the set of all prospects the university has contact information for. Thus, student lists are the fundamental input for recruiting campaigns, which target individual prospects by mail, email, and on social media.

@RN4402 asked its clients to rate different "first contact" interventions (e.g., off-campus recruiting visit) as sources of inquiries and enrolled students. For the median public university, student list purchases were the highest source of inquiries, accounting for 26\% of inquiries, and accounted for 14\% of enrolled students, which ranked fourth after "application as first contact" (19\%), campus visit (17\%), and off-campus visit (16\%).

Although the federal government does not collect data about list buying behavior, we feel safe stating that the majority of BA granting public and private non-profit institutions purchase student lists annually. @RN4741 reported that 28\% of public universities purchased less than 50,000 names, 44\% purchased 50,000-100,000 names, 13\% purchased 100,000-150,000 names, and 15\% purchased more than 150,000 names.

## College Board and ACT Student Lists

The largest student list vendors are College Board and ACT, which create student list products based on their database of test takers. College Board encourages test takers to opt into the "Student Search Service," which enables "accredited colleges, universities, nonprofit scholarship programs, and nonprofit educational organizations" [@cb_opt_in] to "license" their contact information. Similarly, ACT encourages students registering for the PreACT and ACT test to opt into the "Educational Opportunity Service" [@act_opt_in], which "provides accredited colleges and scholarship agencies with the names and contact information of students who opt in" [@RN4752, p. 1]. In fall 2021, the College Board Search and ACT Encoura student list products both charged \$0.50 per name [@RN0002] [GET ACT CITE]. 

### List Contents and Usage

What information do lists contain? Each purchased student list is essentially a spreadsheet that contains one row for each prospect that meets all criteria specified in the purchase. The columns of the student list include detailed contact information (e.g., name, address, email) and detailed student characteristics derived from the pre-test questionnaire (e.g., ethnicity, race, gender, high school GPA, graduation year, high school code, intended major, first-generation status). The data template for an ACT student list can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rsP45OyOsnPYhV8uWYKDAy_spGhjj6aj/view) and the template for a College Board student list can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qvc_QRi9izEF1W78Lh4nNi5NsXjCZqUE/view). These fields represent a small subset of the information the testing agencies know about prospective students and contain little data about performance on assessments (e.g., SAT score).

How are purchased lists utilized? Student lists are the basic building block for recruiting "campaigns" that use algorithms to inform recruiting interventions. However, both the algorithms and the interventions must be fed data about prospects (e.g., cannot send an email without an email address). Once purchased, student lists are layered with additional data sources, such as consumer data about prospects from credit companies, records of interactions with prospects (e.g., visiting virtual tour), historical application/enrollment data about students who attended the same high school, etc. These layered data are the input to predictive models that inform decisions about which recruiting interventions to send to which prospects (e.g., who gets a \$0.50 postcard and who gets a \$7 brochure). 

### Search Filters

How do universities purchase student lists from College Board Student Search Service and ACT's Encoura platform? Each purchased list is a subset of prospects from the population of test-takers. Universities control which prospects are included in a particular list by specifying multiple search filters. @schmidt_2019 states that commonly specified search filters for ACT Encoura include high school graduation year, high school GPA, test score range (ACT or PreACT), gender, ethnicity, intended major, and geography (e.g., state, county, zip code) [@schmidt_2019]. As a hypothetical example, a university could purchase a student list from ACT that consisted of all prospects who scored between 30 and 34 on the ACT, have a GPA higher than 3.5, who live in a particular county, and are in the high school senior class of 2023. 

A consequence of the high price charged per name by the College Board and ACT oligopoly is the incentive for "efficient" name buys, whereby universities only purchase the names of desirable prospects that are likely to apply and enroll. Over the past decade, the testing agencies have catered to this desire for efficiency by adding new search filters -- often based on statistical models -- that enable universities to target prospects with greater precision. ACT has moved more modestly in this direction, adding the "Enrollment Predictor" filter, which allows universities to filter prospects based on their predicted probability of enrolling. College Board has moved more aggressively, adding “geodemographic” filters that target prospects based on the historical behavior behavior of students from their high school or neighborhood. 



### Geodemographic Search Filters

Geodemographic search filters are efficint tools of micro-targeting, which we believe can – knowingly or unknowingly – result in racial redlining. College Board began offering geodemographic search filters with the creation of the Segment Analysis Service (herein Segment). Segment is an add-on to the Student Search Service that enables universities to filter prospects based on the college-going characteristics of the high schools prospects attend or the neighborhoods prospects live in. @RN4565 markets Segment as "an Educationally Relevant Geodemographic Tagging Service." Geodemography -- now often referred to as "spatial big data" -- is a branch of market research that estimates the behavior of consumers based on where they live. According to @RN4565:

> The basic tenet of geodemography is that people with similar cultural backgrounds, means, and perspectives naturally gravitate toward one another or form relatively homogeneous communities; in other words, birds of a feather flock together. When they are living in a community, people\ldots share similar patterns of consumer behavior toward products, services, media, and promotions. The primary appeal of geodemography from the marketer's perspective is that, with just an address, s/he can begin to craft an image about a particular set of individuals based on the values, tastes, expectations, and behaviors associated with their geographic community (p. 1).

This quote illustrates that geodemography is based on problematic assumptions. People with similar cultural backgrounds do not "naturally gravitate toward one another" [@RN4565, p. 1]. Rather, U.S. neighborhoods and schools are racially segregated because of historic and ongoing systematic discrimination embedded in policy and law [@harris1993whiteness; @rothstein2017color]. Product marketing decisions that are based on geodemography are likely to reinforce the race-based inequities in opportunity have been fundamental to creating and maintaining racial segregation.

To build Segment, College Board integrates information about test-takers and their neighborhood and school -- including historical college going behavior. These data are grouped by high school and grouped by neighborhood (census-tract). Next, cluster analysis is used to "to group the 33,000+ high schools and 44,000 neighborhoods into 29 unique high-school types and 33 unique neighborhood types" [@RN4565, p. 4], resulting in high school (HS) clusters HS:51-HS:79 and educational neighborhood (EN) clusters EN:51-EN:83. 

The problem is that Segment neighborhood and high school clusters are highly correlated with both racial and income demographics. For example, educational neighborhood cluster EN:61 is 30\% nonwhite and has median income of \$123,858 while cluster EN:71 is 97% nonwhite and has median income of \$42,661 [@RN4565, p. 5]. Similarly, high school cluster HS:70 is 33\% nonwhite and has median income of \$105,721 while cluster HS:71 is 98% nonwhite and has median income of \$43,391  [@RN4565, p. 6].

When buying names, a Segment customer may purchase prospects who scored within a particular range on the SAT, and live in a particular set of metropolitan areas, and who are associated with particular combinations of neighborhood and high school cluster (e.g., live in educational neighborhood cluster EN61 and attend any high school; live in neighborhood cluster EN73 and high school categories HS:65 or HS:70). 


<!-- CUT TEXT ON BUILDING SEGMENT
__Building Segment__. The prospect-level underlying Segment "begins with the most detailed pieces of information available to the College Board about college-bound students: their actual responses to a series of detailed, academically relevant questions that are asked when they register for various assessments" [@RN4565, p. 3]. These data are additionally layered with "other relevant data elements, such as individual student test-performance results and individual student test-score sending patterns, [that] are attached to each record" [@RN4565, p. 3]. These prospect-level data are merged to data about their high school and neighborhood, including historical individual-level data about college choice that is aggregated to the school or neighborhood level. 

Next, the resulting prospect-level dataset is grouped two ways: at the high school level (over 33,000 high schools) and at the neighborhood level, with neighborhoods defined by Census tracts (about 44,000 neighborhoods). Finally, to "enable us to sort prospective students into a set of behavioral 'types'"[@RN4565, p. 5],  Cluster analysis is used "to group the 33,000+ high schools and 44,000 neighborhoods into 29 unique high-school types and 33 unique neighborhood types referred to as clusters" [@RN4565, p. 4]. In the resulting final product, each neighborhood is assigned to one of 33 educational neighborhood (EN) clusters -- numbered EN:51-EN:83 -- and each high school is assigned to one of 29 high school (HS) clusters -- numbered HS:51-HS:79. 
-->

In Fall 2021, College Board's basic Student Search Service added three "[Environmental Attributes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmTU9sb4ZiY)" geodemographic search filters: Travel Rates (out-of-state), Travel Rates (distance from home), and AP engagement rates. Using out-of-state travel reads as example, each high school is categorized as "low," "medium," or "high" in terms of the percentage of college students who attend an out-of-state university. In turn, a Student Search Service customer could purchase prospects who live in a particular metro area, with PSAT scores within some interval, and attend a high school with a "high" out-of-state travel rate. 

Geodemographic search filters raise two concerns for equality of opportunity. First, geodemographic filters can -- intentionally and unintentionally -- lead to redlining because racial segregation occurs at fine-grained geographic levels and geodemographic filters facilitate targeting at fine-grained geographic levels. Although filtering particular zip codes raies similar concerns, geodemographic filters are more fine-grained, filtering at the census-tract or school level. Furthermore, geodemographic filters enable customers to purchase prospects who attend a particular "kind" of school  or live in a particular "kind" of neighborhood without explicitly naming the school or neighborhood. The second concern is that geodemographic filters deny opportunities to individuals based on the actions of others. Geodemographic filters target prospects based on the characteristics -- including historic college-going behaviors -- of their school or neighborhood. Thus, a prospects who meets the academic achievement criteria may be excluded from the student list purchase because they attend a high school with "low" distance-from-home travel rates.

## The Changing Market for Student List Data

Student lists are central to a surprisingly dynamic ecosystem of enrollment management. This section sketches the contours of the enrollment management ecosystem -- what are the technologies, who are the players and what do they want -- and describes recent shifts in the market for student list data. Over the past 20 years, advances in technology that gave rise to the EdTech sector also yielded new sources of student list data, which created opportunities for entry by new firms and were also incorporated by existing players. In the 2000s, several upstart firms promised to compete with College Board and ACT student list products by creating college search engines, but many of these efforts failed. In the 2010s, mirroring broader trends in the EdTech sector, a surge of acquisitions has reshaped the student list business, increasing concentration in the market for student list data.

As the test-optional movement gains momentum, PowerSchool -- a firm that sells information systems software to high schools -- and EAB -- an enrollment management consulting firm, have emerged as important suppliers of student list data. Meanwhile, College Board and ACT have leveraged their position in the student list business to enter the market for enrollment management consulting.

### Universities and Enrollment Management Consulting Firms

Although the customers of student list vendors are universities looking for students, we cannot understand the student list business without considering the role of enrollment management consulting firms. Over the past twenty years, as recruiting became more sophisticated and competitive, a growing number of universities hired consultancies to develop and/or implement recruiting campaigns. Contributing to this trend, university leaders often fire senior enrollment and admissions professionals when enrollment does not meet targets. In turn, employee turnover reduces in-house capacity, making universities more dependent on external consultants.

Although enrollment management consulting firms depend on universities as their primary source of revenue, they also depend on student list vendors for two reasons. First, a core service offered by most firms is making recommendations about student list purchases and executing these purchases (e.g., [Ruffalo Noel Levitz](https://www.ruffalonl.com/enrollment-management-solutions/building-demand/student-search-and-engagement/), [Fire Engine Red](https://www.fire-engine-red.com/data-services/)). Second, student lists are an essential input to the predictive models and to the recruiting interventions (e.g., email, mail, social media) that the consultancies provide.

The market for enrollment management consulting consists of large firms providng the full range of enrollment services and smaller firms providing particular services. Anecdotally, the number of small and medium sized firms increased from 2000 to 2010, catalyzed advances in digital technology and data science. Since 2010, horizontal acquisitions have caused the market for enrollment management consulting to become more concentrated [@rogers_2014]. For example, RuffaloCODY acquired Noel-Levitz in 2014 [[CITE](https://www.ruffalonl.com/about-ruffalo-noel-levitz/press-releases/ruffalocody-announces-merger-with-noel-levitz/)] and EAB acquired the enrollment management business of Hobsons in 2021 [CITE]. By 2022, the enrollment management consulting market consisted of two large firms -- Ruffalo Noel Levitz, which claims to serve "1,900 campuses and nonprofits" each year [CITE](https://www.ruffalonl.com/about-ruffalo-noel-levitz/), and EAB, which claimed to serve "more than 1,100 higher education institutions" in 2021 [CITE](https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/spotlight/eab-school-communication-covid19/) -- and a shrinking number of small and mid-sized operations (e.g., [Fire Engine Red](https://www.fire-engine-red.com/), [Capture Higher Ed](https://www.capturehighered.com/)).^[Additionally, College Board and ACT have leveraged their position in the student list market to enter the enrollment management consulting market [@encoura_eduventures; @cbsearch_analytics], offering clients information about prospective students that is not included in purchased lists.]


### Sources of Student List Data

Student list data are created by several data generating processes. Prior to the 21st century, student list data on college-going high school students were derived from two primary sources. First, data were generated by students completing standardized assessments developed by testing companies College Board, ACT, and ETS. Second, organizations like the National Research Center for College and University (NRCCUA) asked high school students to complete a survey during school hours.

In the 21st Century, advances in technology yielded new sources of student list data. One source consists of survey data -- and their user data -- that students submit to search engines and social network platforms that focus on college search. One subset of platforms (e.g., Cirkled In, Zinch) has the explicit goal of sharing profiles created by students with the universities the student expresses interest in attending. Another subset of platforms has the explicit goal of helping students find "match" universities and scholarships (e.g., [myOptions](https://myoptions.org/students/), [Cappex](https://www.cappex.com/)). Aside from the privacy policy page, these sites tend to avoid clear language about whether/how student data are shared.^[Both College Board and ACT have incorporated search engines into their student list products. College Board developed the college search website "[BigFuture](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/)." In 2021, College Board added the "[Interest in My College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1DIfObi8w0)" search filter to Student Search Service, whereby universities can filter for prospects who expressed interest in their university when searching for colleges on [BigFuture](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/). ACT achieved similar ends by acquiring NRCCUA in 2018. Years earlier, NRCCUA had replaced the paper surveys that students filled out during school with an online college search engine named [myOptions](https://myoptions.org/). The ACT Encoura platform incorporates student list data derived from ACT assessments and data derived from the [myOptions](https://myoptions.org/) search engine.]

Another source student list data comes from software platforms used by high schools and high school students (e.g., [Naviance](https://www.powerschool.com/solutions/naviance-by-powerschool/), [Scoir](https://www.scoir.com/students-families?hsLang=en-us)]. For example, Naviance enables high school students -- and guidance counselors -- to plan/search for colleges.

<!-- CUT TEXT
For example, [Naviance](https://www.powerschool.com/solutions/naviance-by-powerschool/) enables students to plan for college and enables guidance counselors to help students with the college search process. In turn, Naviance user data provide the basis for [Intersect](https://eab.com/intersect/), a software product that enables universities to send advertising messages to high school students using Naviance.^[Similarly, Scoir develops college search and application software for high school students and counselors [[CITE](https://www.scoir.com/students-families?hsLang=en-us)], while also enabling universities to message students that meet criteria specified by the university [[CITE](https://www.scoir.com/colleges)].]

### EAB Enters the Student List Business

<!-- CUT TEXT
EAB is an enrollment management consulting firm offering solutions across the student life cycle, including marketing and recruiting, financial aid and pricing, and student success
-->
EAB is an enrollment management consulting firm. EAB does not sell student lists. Nevertheless, by the end of 2021, EAB arguably joined College Board and ACT as one of the three most important suppliers of names to universities. Whereas any accredited institution can purchase names from College Board and ACT, only EAB clients have access to prospect databases controlled by EAB. How did this come to be? To a great extent, the EAB story is a story about acquisitions.

The origins of EAB trace to 1983 when Bill Royall founded Royall \& Company to provide direct marketing and fundraising for political campaigns [@jump_2020]. However, by 1995, universities became the primary client. In 2015, the Advisory Board Company -- a technology and consulting company operating in the health sector -- purchased Royall \& Company for \$850 million as the centerpiece of its entrance into the higher education consulting market [@street_insider_2014]. In 2017, the Royall \& Company business line was sold to Vista Equity Partners, the largest private equity firm in the world, for $1.5 billion and renamed EAB [@drew_hansen_2017]. 

Under Vista, EAB pursued vertical acquisitions that increased the value of existing activities and also leveraged relationships with other Vista subsidiaries.
<!-- CUT TEXT

-->

__YouVisit and Cappex__. In 2019, EAB acquired YouVisit, "the leading provider of virtual tour and interactive web content" [@eab_2019], enhancing "EAB's ability to help colleges and universities find, engage, and enroll new students" (para.1). In 2020 EAB acquired Cappex, a college/scholarship search website reportedly used by 1.5 million students annually [@eab_2020].  The President of EAB Enrollment Services said the Cappex acquisition 

> 'will enable EAB partners to identify and engage prospective students who do not interact with schools through the traditional channels, such as campus visits or standardized tests. By expanding schools' inquiry pools, we can help institutions grow and diversify their student populations' [@eab_2020, para.5].

As fewer high school students take the SAT/ACT, Cappex represents a proprietary pool of prospects that cannot be purchased from College Board or ACT. Universities that wish to recruit these prospects must pay EAB for consulting and subscription services. The YouVisit acquisition, rebranded as [EAB virtual tours](https://eab.com/products/virtual-tours/), can be thought of as an "inquiry engine"; the virtual tours record IP address, submitted contact information, and user behavior to help university clients know "who your visitors are and where their interests lie so that you can effectively recruit them" [[CITE](https://eab.com/products/virtual-tours/)].

<!-- CUT TEXT
Now integrated within the EAB platform, the Cappex and YouVisit acquisitions complement one another. High school students searching for colleges or scholarships on Cappex are served the virtual tours of EAB clients, which in turn yields inquiries for clients that pay for [EAB virtual tours](https://eab.com/products/virtual-tours/). Thus, the Cappex acquisition increases the value of the YouVisit acquisition and the YouVisit acquisition increases the value of the Cappex acquisition.

__Hobsons and Naviance/Intersect__. In 2021, EAB and PowerSchool -- a K-12 software provider owned by Vista -- acquired and split the assets of the EdTech firm Hobsons. Hobson's, one of the largest enrollment management consultancies, operated three software-as-service products: Naviance, college search/planning software sold to high schools; Intersect, a recruitment platform that connects universities to Naviance users; and, Starfish, a student success platform for colleges and universities. In the Hobsons acquisition, PowerSchool acquired Naviance and Intersect for \$320 million. EAB acquired Starfish for \$90 million [@wan_2021] and also took over Hobsons' university consulting contracts, thereby increasing market share in the enrollment management consulting market. 

Following the acquisition, PowerSchool agreed to make EAB "the exclusive provider of the Intersect student recruitment platform" [@eab_2021, para.2]. The agreement has a ten-year term and EAB paid PowerSchool \$32.4 million for the first year [@powerschool_ipo].

How does this exclusive reseller agreement position EAB as a supplier of student lists? Naviance is reportedly used by more than 10 million students and by 40% of US high schools [@powerschool]. Intersect enables "colleges and universities to target students [Naviance users] with paid advertisements encouraging them to enroll"  [@markup_naviance]. Although Intersect customers (universities) do not receive the contact information of Naviance users, they control which Naviance users will receive recruiting messages by selecting on search filters similar to those of College Board student list products [@markup_naviance]. EAB promotional material claims that Intersect is effective at funneling Naviance users to universities [@eab_2021_2]. Because EAB is the exclusive reseller of Intersect, universities cannot recruit Naviance users unless they become EAB clients. Considering the likely decline in SAT/ACT test-takers and the number of students who use Naviance to search for college, the reseller agreement will likely result in more clients for EAB.

Although Intersect customers (universities) do not receive the contact information of Naviance users, they control which Naviance users will receive recruiting messages by filtering on criteria such as geographic location, academic "ability," intended majors, and whether the student used Naviance to "research competitor institutions" [@markup_naviance]. Because EAB is the exclusive reseller of Intersect, universities cannot recruit Naviance users unless they become EAB clients. EAB promotional material states that Intersect is effective at funneling Naviance users to EAB clients [@eab_2021_2].

# Policy Concerns {#concerns}

We consider policy concerns and solutions in relation to the ideal of equality of opportunity in college access, the idea that all students should have the opportunity to attend a high-quality college or university, regardless of race, gender, creed, parental education, household income, or where they live.

Research strongly suggests that student lists have large effects on college access outcomes [@RN4739; @RN4752], particularly for first-generation students and students from historically underserved racial and ethnic groups. The surprising importance of student lists for college access in the U.S. is a consequence of federal higher education policy and the structure of the market for higher education. Federal higher education policy provides funding to students but depends on Title IV institutions to provide access; since federal funds follow students, institutions have an incentive to find and enroll students. However, institutions don't know who the prospective students are or how to contact them. This is the problem that student lists solve. Therefore, at the top of the enrollment funnel, universities identify "leads" by buying student lists from College Board, ACT, and other vendors. 

Unfortunately, the student list business undermines equality of opportunity for students because of several reasons. An overarching reason is that student list products are oriented to the enrollment goals of universities rather than the opportunity goals of students because universities are the paying customers. This explanation suggests that the underlying policy problem is university enrollment preferences, not student lists. To a certain extent -- and for certain institutions -- this is true; if a university only wants to enroll wealthy students, regulating student lists will not compel the university to enroll poor students. That said, the choices universities make about which names to purchase are structured by the architecture of student list products -- which prospects are included in the product, the targeting behaviors allowed by the product, the targeting behaviors encouraged by the product.

The search filters on College Board and ACT student list products facilitate the exclusion of prospective students. For example, universities often search for STEM majors by filtering on AP exam scores, but which students attend high schools with widespread access to AP classes? Geographic filters (e.g., buy prospects in particular zip codes) often conflict with the ideal that educational opportunity should not depend on where you live. Filtering at the zip code level is dangerous because zip codes are highly correlated with race. Filtering for particular metropolitan areas is dangerous because what about students who live outside the metropolitan area? College Board geodemographic filters are particularly problematic because they filter at fine-grained geographic levels --  the Census tract, the high school --  and Census tract level and they simultaneously filter students based on the historic behavior of students from that school/neighborhood rather than the achievement of the prospect.

Another source of exclusion is which prospects are included in the underlying database. College Board and ACT student list products exclude students who do not take College Board or ACT assessments. Test-taking rates have differed by race and by class since 1972 [@RN2275], when College Board created the Student Search Service. These differences yield racial and socioeconomic inequality in which prospects are contacted by universities. As test-optional becomes the new normal, the number of SAT/ACT test-takers will decline dramatically, and in ways that may be correlated with race, class, and geography. In turn, the eroding coverage of these lists may trigger a crisis in college access because universities will not know who the prospective students are or how to contact them.

In (micro-economics) theory, market entry by new student list suppliers will offset the erosion of College Board and ACT databases. This perspective is consistent with the idea that competitive markets are generally better for consumers than oligopolies. We fear that, without significant government intervention, the death of the SAT/ACT exam will hurl student list market into a Game of Thrones style "war of all against all" [@RN1403] that negatively affects college access. The reasoning behind our skepticism is four-fold; first, we doubt that these new entrants will achieve -- even in aggregate -- the coverage achieved by College Board/ACT prior to test optional; second, with so many student list vendors, universities will be confused about which vendors have data for which prospects; third, large suppliers (e.g., PowerSchool, EAB) will attempt to recreate oligopoly conditions; and, fourth, large suppliers have learned to maximize profit not by selling names to any university but by restricting access to universities that pay for expensive subscription or consulting services.

# Regulating the Student List Business {#regulation}

Having laid out the policy concerns, how should federal policymakers think aout regulating the student list business? Industries are regulated by laws that prescribe rules and by regulatory agencies that enforce those laws. In its present form, the Higher Education Act (HEA) -- enforced by the U.S. Department of Education -- is incapable of regulating the student list business. However, laws enforced by other regulatory agencies may be relevant to particular aspects of the student list business. Our goal is to start the conversation about federal regulation. We believe this conversation should be approached in three buckets: regulating student list products; regulating student list suppliers; and regulating student list customers.


## Regulating Products

Federal policymakers have become increasingly concerned about products that utilize "big data," "artificial intelligence," "algorithms," and "predictive analytics," citing research findings that "apparently 'neutral' technology can produce troubling outcomes -- including discrimination by race or other legally protected classes" [@RN4749, para.1]. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has authority over commercial products and is viewed as the federal regulatory agency most responsible for addressing these concerns. FTC concerns and guidelines on these issues emerged over the past decade following several reports and hearings [e.g., @RN4746; @RN4744; @RN4743; @RN4748; @RN4749; @ftc_2019]. We highlight two reports in particular, _Data Brokers: A Call for Transparency and Accountability_ [@RN4744] and _Big Data: A Tool for Inclusion or Exclusion?_ [@RN4743].

__Marketing data brokers__. @RN4744 defines "data brokers" as "companies that collect consumers' personal information `and resell or share that information with others" [@RN4744, p. i]. @RN4744 distinguished between three categories of data brokers: (1) "consumer reporting agencies" covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA); (2) marketing data brokers which sell consumer data to businesses looking for customers (e.g., student lists); and (3) entities not covered by FCRA that use consumer data for non-marketing purposes, such as fraud detection. Student list vendors clearly fall within the @RN4744 definition of marketing data brokers. 

The products sold by marketing data brokers enable businesses to buy data about some customers but not others. A common approach is to categorize customers into different "segments." For example, one marketing data broker analyzed by @RN4744 developed the category "Married Sophisticates" which consists of "upper-middle class [couples] \ldots with no children" and the category "Rural Everlasting" which consists of single people older than 66 with "low educational attainment and low net worth" [@RN4744, p.20]. The College Board Segment Analysis Service product adopts a similar approach when it categorizes every high school into one of 29 types and categorizes every neighborhood into one of 33 types [@RN4565]. Another common practice by marketing data brokers is assigning scores to customers based on their likelihood of making a purchase or responding to a marketing intervention [@RN4744]. An example of this approach is the "Enrollment Predictor" prospect search filter in ACT's Encoura student list product, which enables universities to filter prospects based on the predicted probability they will enroll [@schmidt_2019].

__Policy concerns__ @RN4743 described concerns about products sold by marketing data brokers that utilize big data, algorithms, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics. Student list products clearly fall within @RN4743 policy concerns.^[For example, ACT states that the Encoura Platform -- which includes student lists -- "is an enrollment management technology platform that combines student intelligence data, advanced analytics" [@encoura_2021, para.2].]

Broadly, @RN4743 (p.9.) is concerned that these technologies "categorize consumers in ways that can result in exclusion of certain populations" [@RN4743, p.9]. @RN4743 (p. 2) states that "if big data analytics incorrectly predicts that particular consumers are not likely to respond\ldots [or] are not good candidates for prime credit offers, educational opportunities, or certain lucrative jobs, such educational opportunities, employment, and credit may never be offered to these consumers." One concern is that these technologies create new justifications for exclusion. For example, the Intersect recruiting platoform allows universities to "send targeted messages through Naviance to students who had used the platform to research competitor institutions" [@markup_naviance], thereby excluding students who did not search for competitor institutions.

Another concern is that products increasingly use predictive analytics deny opportunities to individuals based on the actions of others. @RN4743 distinguishes _descriptive analytics_, which seek to "uncover and summarize patterns or features that exist in data sets" (p. 4), from "predictive data analytics," which "refers to the use of statistical models to generate new data" (pp. 4-5). Products that utilize predictive analytics can develop algorithms based one one group of people and apply those algorithms to make decisions about a different group of people. For example, [@RN4743, p. 9] states that "some credit card companies have lowered a customer’s credit limit\ldots based on analysis of other customers with a poor repayment history that had shopped at the same establishments where the customer had shopped." The geodemographic filters in the College Board Segment Analysis Service product are based on predictive data analytics in that cluster analysis is used to assign neighborhoods and schools to types [@RN4565]. In turn, geodemographic search filters enable universities to target prospects based on the behaviors of previous cohorts from that neighborhood or high school.


__Guidelines for data brokers__. FTC developed guidelines for businesses about the use of big data, algorithms, and analytics [@RN4743; @RN4748; @RN4749]. These guidelines apply to vendors selling student list products.

First, companies should consider how representative their data are. "If a data set is missing information from particular populations, using that data to build an AI model may yield results that are unfair or inequitable to legally protected groups" [@RN4749]. 

Companies should consider whether the algorithm is biased against protected classes [@RN4749]. For example, @doi1011 found that the algorithm used by a hospital system to predict health care needs was biased against Black patients because the algorithm was based on health care costs rather than illness.

FTC investigations of products consider both discriminatory inputs and discriminatory outcomes [@RN4748]. With respect to discriminatory inputs, FTC examines whether the algorithm explicitly considers a protected class (e.g., race, gender, religion). FTC also investigates whether the algorithm considers inputs that are highly correlated with a protected class. For example, if "a company made credit decisions based on consumers' Zip Codes, resulting in a 'disparate impact' on particular ethnic groups, the FTC could challenge that practice" [@RN4748]. Regardless of algorithm inputs, FTC evaluates whether the product has an "illegal disparate impact on protected classes" [@RN4748].

__FTC investigation and regulation__. The FTC Act authorizes the FTC to "investigate from time to time the organization, business, conduct, practices, and management of any person, partnership, or corporation engaged in or whose business affects commerce" [[CITE](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/mission/enforcement-authority)]. Contemporary student list products exhibit several features described as problematic by FTC guidelines (e.g., unrepresentative data, algorithms that consider inputs highly correlated with protected class, denying opportunities based on the behavior of others, etc.). We recommend that FTC investigate College Board student list products, ACT student list products, and PowerSchool's Intersect product. 

To what extent are student list vendors beholden to FTC regulations? Section 5 of the FTC Act applies to _all_ companies engaging in commerce and prohibits "unfair" practices. A practice is defined as unfair if it meets all three of the following criteria: causes substantial harm to consumers; harm cannot be reasonably avoided; and harm not outweighed by benefits to other consumers [@fdic_2018].

Particular attributes of student list products may meet all three criteria of unfair practices and simultaneously have a disparate impact on protected classes, particularly race. Consider the Segment Analysis Service geodemographic high school "type" filters, which are highly correlated with race (see @RN4565, p. 6). These filters are likely to cause substantial harm to consumers (criterion \#1) because students attending high school types not selected by a university are excluded from outreach. Consumers cannot reasonably avoid the injury (criterion \#2) because they cannot easily change schools. The injury is not reasonably outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition (criterion \#3). The beneficiaries of high school type filters are universities, who are able to target customers more efficiently, and students who attend high school types that universities tend to select. High school type filters do not realistically benefit competition in terms of the price and quality of higher education purchased by students. Applying this logic, other attributes of student list products may be considered unfair practices by the FTC Act. ^[For example, most student list products allow universities to filter by zip code, which is highly correlated with race [@RN4743]. Filtering prospects based on zip code causes harm to students from excluded zip codes (criterion \#1) that cannot reasonably be avoided by students (criterion \#2) and is not outweighed by benefits to consumers or competition (criterion \#3). Similarly, the ability to filter prospects by AP exam score may be an unfair practice because students who attend high schools that do not offer substantial AP curricula are excluded.]

## Regulating Suppliers

As a complement to regulating student list products, federal regulators may target the organizations that supply student list data. We introduce two distinct lines of inquiry, which merit future scrutiny from legal experts. First, can College Board and ACT be designated as "consumer reporting agencies"? Second, is EAB restraining competition in the market for enrollment management consulting by becoming a supplier of student list data?

### Consumer Reporting Agencies

<!-- CUT TEXT
> any information by a consumer reporting agency that bears on a consumer’s creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living that is used \ldots for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer’s eligibility for any of the following: (1) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes; (2) employment purposes; or (3) any other purpose authorized under Section 604 ([15 U.S.C \S 1681a ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681a)).
-->

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FRCA) defines a "consumer report" as information "that bears on a consumer’s creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living" that is used to establish eligibility for "(1) credit or insurance \ldots; (2) employment purposes; or (3) any other purpose authorized under Section 604 ([15 U.S.C \S 1681a ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681a)). In turn, a "consumer reporting agency" is any entity that sells consumer reports for monetary fees. 

Consumer reporting agencies are regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act -- enforced by the FTC -- and by the Consumer Finance Protection Act -- enforced by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. Amongst other requirements, consumer reporting agencies must demonstrate that their products do not discriminate on the basis of protected classes, including race/ethnicity. Are College Board and ACT consumer reporting agencies? Setting aside the legal argument for legal experts, we develop a logical argument that student lists systematically lead to the extension of credit (i.e., loans).

Across all Title IV institutions, tuition is the largest revenue source [[CITE](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d20/tables/dt20_333.10.asp)]. Federal financial aid accounts for a substantial share of tuition revenue [@RN3578]. In 2021, total student loan debt in the U.S. was  \$1.75 trillion -- second only to mortgages as the largest source of debt -- and the Federal Student Loan Portfolio was \$1.61 trillion, accounting for 92\% of total student debt [@hanson_2022].

The enrollment funnel identifies stages in the process of recruiting students in order to inform interventions that convert prospective students from one stage to the next. At the top of the enrollment funnel, universities identify "leads" by purchasing "student lists." A substantial share of admits that receive financial aid packages are initially identified from student list purchases. Based on information contained in student lists, some purchased prospects are not recruited while others are targeted with recruiting interventions designed to "convert" leads to inquiries and applicants. Financial aid is the primary intervention universities utilize to convert admits to enrolled students [@RN1948; @RN2110]. Financial aid interventions include institutional grant aid, guidance about how much to borrow and how to apply for federal and/or private loans, and some institutions originate their own loans [@sbpc2020; @berk_law_2021].

Finally, many colleges and universities have adopted an organizational structure in which a vice president-level office of enrollment management controls the activities of undergraduate recruiting, admissions, and financial aid [@RN3625; @RN2406]. Thus, strategy about student list purchases and financial aid packages are not made autonomously from one another but rather represent the coordinated efforts of different limbs of the same body.


### Anti-Competitive Behavior

<!-- 
CUT TEXT
The mission of the FTC Bureau of Competition is to prevent anti-competitive business practices by enforcing antitrust law, a role it shares with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. 

Antitrust regulations represent another approach to regulating organizations operating in the market for student list data. 

Horizontal agreements refer to agreements between competitors in the same market, and horizontal agreements that restrain competition are called _horizontal restraints_. 

Antitrust law is concerned with vertical restraints that are anti-competitive in that "they hurt competition more than they help competition" including vertical agreements that "raise prices, limit output, restrain or exclude competitors, or decrease the available variety of products or services" [@wspodcast, para.9-10].
-->

Antitrust regulations seek to eliminate anti-competitive business practices, which are practices that restrain competition in a market, resulting in higher prices, lower product quality, and/or fewer choices for consumers. Antitrust law is concerned with two types of inter-firm agreements [@wspodcast], horizontal agreements and vertical agreements. _Horizontal agreements_ refer to agreements between competitors in the same market. College Board and ACT operate an oligopoly in the student list market, but oligopolies are legal unless there is evidence that the firms engaged in an agreement (e.g., price collusion) [@RN4750], which seems unlikely. _Vertical agreements_ refer to agreements between firms that operate at complementary points in the supply chain (e.g., a retailer promotes the products of a manufacturer in exchange for a price discount). _Vertical restraints_ are agreements that affect competition. Antitrust law is concerned with vertical restraints that "hurt competition more than they help competition," including vertical agreements that "raise prices, limit output, restrain or exclude competitors, or decrease the available variety of products or services" [@wspodcast, para.9-10]. Antitrust regulators may be concerned that vertical agreements that make EAB an important supplier of student names, may negatively affect competition in the market for enrollment management consulting.

__Competition in enrollment management consulting__. Why should policymakers be concerned about competition in the market for enrollment management consulting? Consultants develop and implement strategy in the domains of marketing and recruiting, pricing and financial aid, and student success. Enrollment management consultants have become essential because most postsecondary institutions lack internal capacity in these three domains, which have become increasingly complicated over the last two decades. 

The consulting market is currently dominated by EAB and Ruffalo Noel Levitz -- which claim to serve than 3,000 postsecondary institutions collectively [[CITE](https://www.ruffalonl.com/about-ruffalo-noel-levitz/),[CITE](https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/spotlight/eab-school-communication-covid19/)]. The number of small and medium-sized firms has declined following a surge in horizontal acquisitions/ Further, most small/medium-sized firms cannot offer the range of services offered by EAB and Ruffalo Noel Levitz. Economic theory states that a declines in the number of suppliers enables the remaining firms to charge higher prices because customers that need the product have no choice but to pay. If university expenditure on enrollment management consulting increases, these costs will ultimately be passed on to students in the form of higher tuition prices.

Additionally, we are concerned that increasing concentration in the enrollment management consulting market may lead to de facto collusion between universities. A recent lawsuit alleges 16 selective universities colluded to reduce financial aid [[CITE](https://www.salon.com/2022/01/10/yale-brown-columbia-and-13-others-sued-over-collusion-to-limit-financial-aid-for-students/)]. Consider the consequencues of thousdands of postsecondary institutions relying on the same two enrollment management consulting firms for strategy about marketing/recruiting, tuition pricing, and financial aid. Here, a third-party consultancy makes recommendations about the tuition price and financial aid offers of universities that are in direct competition with one another. How do consulting firms decide which university recruits which prospective students When two universities face similar student demand? Consulting firms may parcel out prospective students across their clients in ways that negatively affect the college choice options of students and/or negatively affect competition between students.

__Exclusive reseller agreement__. Antitrust regulators may be concerned that the agreement between PowerSchool and EAB, which made EAB the "exclusive reseller of the Intersect student recruitment platform in the United States and Canada" [@powerschool_ipo, p. 193], may negatively affect competition in the market for enrollment management consulting. In effect, the partnership grants EAB exclusive control over Naviance user data for the purpose of college recruiting, enabling EAB to connect university clients to high school students using Naviance. Naviance is reportedly used by 10 million U.S. students and by 40% of U.S. high schools [@powerschool], representing a substantial share of the college-going high school population. 

The exclusive reseller agreement may harm other enrollment management consulting firms because universities may reason that hiring EAB is the only way to recruit high school students using Naviance.^[Using a similar logic, the EAB acquisition of Cappex may raise concerns about vertical restraints to competition market for enrollment management consulting. Additionally, regulators may be concerned that College Board and ACT are negatively affecting competition by leveraging their position in the student list business to enter the market for enrollment management consulting.] For example, a University of Utah procurement request document states that the "justification" for subscribing to Intersect is that "there is a unique group of prospective students who are only in the PowerSchool Naviance platform [CITE; DOC IN POWERSCHOOL GOOGLE DRIVE]. In turn, competitor EM consultancies will be less able to find prospects for their own clients, making them less valuable to universities. 

Additionally, the agreement may harm universities that are not customers of EAB; these universities may be unable to recruit high school students that use Naviance because EAB funnels Naviance users to EAB client universities. The agreement may also harm high school students who use Naviance in that these students will be funneled to EAB client universities.

## Regulating Customers

Postsecondary institutions are the customers of student list products. We consider policy goals and regulations with respect to the broader goal of equality of opportunity. One policy goal is that the names purchased by a university -- across all lists purchased in a year -- should not not systematically exclude members of a protected class, rural students, or low-income students, a policy goal that encompasses both redlining by selective institutions and reverse redlining by for-profit colleges. One regulation in service of this goal consists of reporting requirements around student list purchases. During our data collection, we noticed that university personnel tended to be less knowledgeable about who the university was targeting when the university outsourced student list purchases to a consulting firm. Therefore, another regulation may be to place limits on outsourcing student list purchases to third-party firms

The Higher Education Act (HEA) regulates federal higher education programs and is enforced by the Department of Education (herein the Department). Title IV of the HEA concerns federal financial aid to students. Postsecondary institutions authorized to enroll students that receive federal financial aid are called Title IV institutions. HEA section 487 states that institutions must sign a "program participation agreement" which defines the requirements for "initial and continuing eligibility" to participate in the Title IV financial aid program ([20 U.S.C. \S 1094](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1094)). 

The program participation agreement empowers the Department to request that Title IV institutions provide information about student list purchases. The statutory language states that Title IV institutions "will complete surveys conducted as a part of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) or any other Federal postsecondary institution data collection effort, as designated by the Secretary" ([HEA section 487(a)(17)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1094)). Providing information about student list purchases need not be onerous, even when the university outsources purchases to a consulting firm. For example, we created a document that explains how to obtain prior student list purchases from the College Board and ACT online portals [PROVIDE LINK]. To minimize burden, universities could omit lists purchased from small vendors. Moving forward, policymakers could commission a tool that helps universities obtain the requested data, describes the characteristics of purchased prospects, and compares the characteristics of purchased prospects to other populations of interest (e.g., high school graduates in the county).

Aside from reporting requirements for Title IV institutions, our main takeaway is that the HEA -- and the Department of education -- is incapable of regulating actors in the market for student list data. For example, Title IV of HEA regulates "third party servicers" but most of these these regulations focus on lenders and guaranty agencies, not student list vendors or enrollment management consultancies.

The example of "incentive based compensation" regulations demonstrates the impotence of the HEA with respect to student lists. In 1992, Congress banned Title IV institutions from providing compensation for "success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities" [[HEA section 487(a)(20)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1094)]. However, these rules explicitly exempt student list purchases: "these activities do not include making a payment to a third party for the provision of student contact information for prospective students provided that such payment is not based on any additional conduct or action by the third party or the prospective students" [[CITE](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/668.14#b_22_i)]. 

Recent policy debate around incentive based compensation has focused on the 2011 "bundled services loophole," which enables online program management companies (OPMs) to engage in tuition sharing agreements [@Shireman2019; @Dimino2020]. We are more interested in the Department of Education's rationale for the loophole:

> The independence of the third party (both as a corporate matter and as a decision maker) from the institution that provides the actual teaching and educational services is a significant safeguard against the abuses the Department has seen heretofore. When the institution determines the number of enrollments and hires an unaffiliated third party to provide bundled services that include recruitment, payment based on the amount of tuition generated does not incentivize the recruiting as it does when the recruiter is determining the enrollment numbers [@usde2011, p.11].

In other words, tuition sharing with third-party vendors is not problematic because the Department believed that enrollment goals are chosen by the institution rather than the vendor. This quote illustrates a fundamental problem with federal higher education policy; it is fixated on a 20th Century conception of the higher education industry. Thus, the Department focuses on regulating Title IV institutions based on the belief that only the behavior of direct providers have consequence for federal policy goals. But in the 21st century, third-party vendors dwarf the size of for-profit college industry. These vendors wield great market power, they influence the behavior of Title IV institutions, and they serve their own interests.

# Public Option {#public}

Student lists play an essential role in the college access process because the U.S. higher education market is structured as a national voucher system that depends on providers to go out and find the students. Unfortunately, the contemporary student list business is characterized by the systematic exclusion of underrepresented students, the certain death of the college entrance exam, and the looming takeover by corporate and private equity interests. Is this the best we can do? Regulation alone cannot solve these problems. We must create a "public option" student list product in order to avoid a college access crisis and to create a higher education system that provides equality of opportunity.

Our plan is inspired by the national voter databases created by created by U.S. political parties (Culliford, 2020). The fundamental input to national voter databases are voter files created by state and local governments, which are essentially free public records. By contrast, the fundamental inputs for College Board and ACT student lists (e.g., contact information, academic achievement, college preferences) are proprietary. We argue that administrative data collected by U.S. high school/districts (e.g., contact information, GPA, course-taking by subject) provides the basis for a viable student list product. Increasingly, states have incorporated high school administrative data into statewide longitudinal data systems. The Arizona Department of Education provides the contact information and high school rank of all AZ high school graduates for free to Arizona [PUBLIC?] postsecondary institutions [CITE].

__National voter databases__. Our plan is inspired by the example of national voter databases. @RN4731 describes how U.S. political parties create and utilize national voter databases in four sequential steps, depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:reuters-voter-database). <!--TODO: [REQUEST PERMISSION FROM REUTERS]-->First, data firms create a national database by cobbling together the voter files of state and local governments, which are essentially free public records. Second, data firms layer on additional information (e.g., income levels, purchasing patterns) from  a "range of sources onto \ldots to create detailed profiles of voters" [@RN4731, para. 6]. Third, predictive models are developed to predict the opinions and behavior of prospective voters. Fourth, the database and predictive models are used to inform campaign decisions. Both the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Democratic National Committee (DNC) have developed processes by which these data can be shared with campaigns and outside political organizations.

```

The way political campaign managers use voter data to inform political campaigns is strikingly similar to the way enrollment managers utilize student lists to inform "recruiting campaigns." However, voter files -- the basic input to national voter databases -- are free, public records. By contrast, the basic inputs for student lists (e.g., contact information, academic achievement, college preferences) are propietary, with College Board and ACT charging \$0.50 per name in 20XX [CITE]. 


__The public option__. Administrative data collected by U.S. high school/districts (e.g., contact information, GPA, course-taking by subject) provides the basis for a viable student list product. Increasingly, states have incorporated high school administrative data into statewide longitudinal data systems. The Arizona Department of Education provides the contact information and high school rank of all AZ high school graduates for free to Arizona [PUBLIC?] postsecondary institutions [CITE].

We propose a student-list product developed by a consortium of states, based on data from statewide longitudinal data systems. Students and parents would have the opportunity to opt in or opt out. The system might allow participants to control which institutions can obtain their contact information (e.g., in-state vs. out-of-state, institutional control). The "names" of students who opt in would be provided to eligible postsecondary institutions for free. The public-option student lists would include information like, contact information, high school code, expected graduation year, high school academic achievement (e.g., high school GPA, math course-taking, science course-taking), demographic information, and limited set of survey responses about college preferences (e.g., intended major).

Several product features are essential for the public option to compete with private sector products. First, the public-option becomes a viable alternative to the extent that it includes more states and a higher share of prospects from these states. Second, a core advantage of the College Board/ACT products is the ability to reach out to prospects early in the college search process (e.g., PSAT, PreACT). Therefore, the public-provision product should enable universities to obtain names of sophomores and juniors who have opted in, a product feature that requires timely data. Third, concerns about missing data and data quality undermined the value of students lists sold by Chegg. Therefore, the public-option must possess data quality on par with College Board/ACT student lists. Fourth, students opting in to the public-option should be required to complete a brief questionnaire to provide data that is valued by enrollment professionals but is not recorded by  high school administrative data (e.g., intended major, how far away from home student wants to be, preferences for public vs. private, etc.).

__Benefits of the public option__. The public option would improve college access and equality of opportunity in several ways. First, students students would not be excluded from name buys because they did not take a particular standardized assessment. Given racial and socioeconomic differences in test-taking rates, moving away from reliance on College Board and ACT databases for name buys will likely increase socioeconomic and racial equality in college access. 

Second, the search filters on College Board and ACT student lists that facilitate micro-targeting (e.g., geodemographic filters, filtering by zip-code) can lead to the systematic exclusion of underrepresented. Universities value these search filters because College Board and ACT charge a high price for names. By offering names for free, the public option eliminates the incentive for "efficient" name buys that target very particular prospects while excluding others. Although free names would not eliminate discrimination in which prospects receive recruiting material, several recruiting interventions have negligible marginal cost (e.g., email, text). Therefore, we believe that free names will result in more recruiting interventions directed at under-recruited student populations, which is important because prior research finds that under-recruited student populations tend to be the most responsive to attention from universities [@RN4324]. ^[Another likely consequence of free names is that students are deluged with emails and text messages.]

Another benefit of the public-option is that money previously spent on buying names can be allocated to other purposes. Furthermore, postsecondary institutions unable to afford names in the past (e.g., many community colleges) could engage in list-based recruiting.

__Political and technical challenges__. Formidable political challenges face the public option. Who will pay for, develop, and maintain the system? State laws restrict sharing statewide longitudinal data and some state policymakers may be concerned about brain-drain from out-of-state universities. Several formidable technical challenges face the public option, relating to the goal goal of creating a timely database that incorporates contact information, transcript data, and demographic information, with data drawn from many states and many schools and districts within each state. In short, creating the public option will be difficult. Alternatively, we can do nothing, inviting a college access crisis as the SAT/ACT exams die and for-profit interests assume control of the student list business. This alternative is unthinkable.
