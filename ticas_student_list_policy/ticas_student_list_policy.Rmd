# Introduction

<!-- SOMEWHERE PROMINANT: researchers and policymakers have ignored student lists -->

Colleges and universities identify prospective students by purchasing "student lists" from College Board, ACT, and other vendors. Student lists contain the contact information of prospective students that meet the criteria (e.g., test score range, high school GPA, zip codes) specified in a student list purchase. Sometimes referred to as "names," student lists are a fundamental input for undergraduate recruiting "campaigns," which target individual prospects by mail, email, and on social media. 

__Student outcomes__. Recent research suggests that student lists have surprisingly large effects on college access outcomes and also on degree completion. Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) reproduces results from @RN4739, which compared outcomes between SAT test-takers who opted into the College Board Student Search Service -- allowing accredited institutions to "licence" their contact information -- and test-takers who opted out, after controlling for covariates like race/ethnicity, parental education, and SAT score, and high school. 41.1\% of students who participated in Search attended a 4-year college compared to 32.8\% of students who opted out, representing an 8.3 (`=41.1-32.8`) percentage point difference and a 25.3 (`=(41.1-32.8)/32.8`) percent change in the relative probability of attending a 4-year college. A similar analysis by @RN4752 found a strong positive relationship between participating in ACT's Educational Opportunity Service (EOS) and college access outcomes.

Furthermore, Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) shows that the change in the relative probability (i.e., percent change) of attending a 4-year institution associated with participating in Search was higher for students who identified as Black (24.5%), Hispanic (34.4%), American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) (23.8%), and Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander (26.1\%) than it was for students who identified as White (21.6\%) or Asian (15.2\%). Similarly, change in the relative probability of attending a four-year college was higher for students whose parents did not attend college (40.6\%) than it was for students whose parents had a BA (18.9\%). 

Given that the probability of graduating is affected by which institution a student attends [e.g., @RN2261; @RN1494], student lists may also affect degree completion through their effect on initial postsecondary institution. @RN4739 analyzed the four-year BA degree completion rates of SAT test-takers from the 2015 and 2016 high school graduation cohorts. Figure \@ref(fig:cb-fig) shows that 20.6\% of students who participated in Search obtained a BA in four years compared to 15.7\% of students who opted out, representing a 31.2\% (`=(20.6-15.7)/15.7`) increase in the relative probability of graduation. Furthermore, the relative increase in the probability of obtaining a BA was higher for Black (40.3\%), Hispanic (43.3\%), and Native American/Alaska Native students (48.3\%) than it was for White (27.9\%) and Asian (28.2\%) students. The relative increase was also higher for students whose parents did not attend college (50.0\%) than it was for students whose parents had a BA (25.3\%).

__The U.S. market for higher education market__. Although these results cannot be considered causal, the magnitude of the findings above are huge even after controlling for a strong set of covariates. How could student lists -- which have been ignored by policymakers and researchers for decades -- be so important for college access in the U.S.? 

The answer begins with understanding the market for higher education and the role played by federal financial aid. U.S higher education is a market-based system consisting of a mix of providers -- public, private non-profit, for-profit -- in which the federal government takes a "steer don't row" approach, using subsidies and regulations to encourage providers to achieve government goals around college access and degree completion. Aside from research funding, the federal government subsidizes higher education primarily by providing Title IV grants and loans to students. These funds follow students to whichever Title IV postsecondary institutions they attend, thereby creating a national voucher system. The largest revenue source for most Title IV institutions is tuition, which is composed of household savings and grants and loans, including federal financial aid. Thus, postsecondary institutions have an incentive to enroll students who can afford the cost of attendance and the Title IV financial aid system creates an incentive to enroll students who are eligible for federal grants and loans.

What is the role of student lists in the US higher education market? Student lists are a match-making intermediary that connects institutions -- which must enroll students to survive -- to prospective students -- who want to acquire human capital. From the university perspective, beyond the basic requirement of survival, universities pursue some set of broad enrollment goals (e.g., academic profile, racial diversity, tuition revenue), while also meeting the needs of various campus constituencies (e.g., College of Engineering needs majors, marching band needs players) [@RN3519]. Universities cannot realize these goals solely from prospects who find the university on their own; they must find desirable prospects who can be convinced to enroll. However, universities don't know who these prospects are, where they are, or how to contact them. Student lists overcome the problem faced by universities, providing the contact information of prospects who satisfy criteria specified by the university. 

From the perspective of prospective students facing the problem of not knowing all of their college options, student lists enable interested universities to contact them. In practice, student list products are oriented to university enrollment goals rather than student opportunity goals because universities are the customers that pay for lists. 

__College Board and ACT student list products__. College Board and ACT student list products systematically exclude underrepresented student populations in two ways. First, only test-takers are included in the underlying student list databases. Second, student list products utilize "search filters" (e.g., test score range, GPA, zip-code, intended major) to control which prospects are included/excluded in a student list purchase. Over the past decade, College Board and ACT have added new search filters that enable universities to make "efficient" name buys that target "right fit" prospects. For example, College Board "geodemographic" filters target prospects based on the past behavior of students from their high school and their neighborhood. We argue that search filters that facilitate micro-targeting contribute to systematic exclusion of students from communities color, low-income communities, and rural communities.

__The test-optional movement__. Over the past 50 years in the U.S., the process of college access has substantially depended on the SAT/ACT college entrance exam being a strong, taken-for-granted institution. Once leading public and private universities adopted the SAT/ACT exam as an admissions requirement, other universities followed suit because this became what "legitimate" universities do. In turn, college-going high school students were compelled to take either the SAT or the ACT, creating unparalleled databases of prospective students, which became the basis of College Board and ACT student list products. 

The test-optional and test-blind movement has deinstitutionalized the SAT and ACT college entrance exams. This is not a temporary blib, but the new normal [CITE](https://www.fairtest.org/more-1815-schools-do-not-require-actsat-scores-cur). Although proponents of equity in college _admissions_ applaud the demise of college entrance exams, these exams have been central to the functioning of college _access_, which is bigger than college admissions. As a by-product of these exams, students lists are an essential mechanism of college access that connects Title IV institutions -- who need students to survive -- to prospective students. In the coming years, the number of college-going students who take the SAT or ACT will fall precipitously, eroding the coverage of College Board and ACT student lists. Unless viable alternatives to College Board and ACT lists emerge, we anticipate a crisis in college access because Title IV institutions will be unable to connect with prospective students.

__The market for student list data__. The contemporary market for student list data is surprisingly dynamic, marked by advances in technology, new sources of student list data, and entry by for-profit EdTech interests. While the 2000s promised greater competition -- primarily from college search engine websites -- the market has become increasingly concentrated following a recent surge in acquisitions. Large enrollment management consulting firms -- particularly EAB -- and firms providing software to high schools (e.g., PowerSchool) have positioned themselves to acquire market share ceded by College Board and ACT. Over the past 20 years, these firms have learned to maximize profit by controlling a unique database of prospects and restricting access to institutions that pay for consulting services.

__Policy solutions__. The policy problem is student lists are oriented to university enrollment goals rather than equality of opportunity for students. Currently, the market for student list data is an oligopoly in which College Board and ACT student list products systematically exclude students from underrepresented populations. Looking forward, the for-profit interests positioned to control the market for student list data are even more problematic than College Board and ACT because these firms will funnel prospective students only to universities that have paid for consulting services. 

In order to avoid a college access crisis as the test-optional movement gains momentum, we must regulate current practices while we develop a public alternative student list product that is oriented to equality of opportunity. This policy report develops the foundation for a multi-faceted reform agenda. The first substantive section provides essential background information about how the student list business works and how it is changing. Second, we discuss regulations, considering the regulation of student list products, student list suppliers, and student list customers (i.e., universities). Finally, we propose a "public option" student list product based on state administrative data that would avoid the targeting concerns of existing products by providing prospect names (those who opt in) to universities for free.

BRIEF PARAGRAPH STATING WHAT SECTION DOES

## The Enrollment Funnel

The "enrollment funnel" -- depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:em-funnel) -- is a conceptual visualization used in the enrollment management industry that describes stages in the process of recruiting students (e.g., prospects, leads, inquiries, applicants, admits, and enrolled students). "Prospects" are all desirable potential students. "Leads" are prospects whose contact information has been obtained. "Inquiries" are prospects that contact your institution and consist of two types: first, inquiries who respond to an initial solicitation  (e.g., email) from the university; and second, "student as first contact" inquiries who reach out to the university on their own, for example, by sending ACT scores to the institution or by taking a "[virtual tours](https://eab.com/products/virtual-tours/)" that records IP address. Applicants consist of inquiries who apply plus "stealth applicants" who do not contact the university before applying.

```{r em-funnel, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "The enrollment funnel", out.width = "40%"}
knitr::include_graphics('./../assets/images/enrollment_funnel.png')
```

The enrollment funnel is based on the "marketing funnel," in which "marketers cast a broad net to capture as many leads as possible, and then slowly nurture prospective customers through the purchasing decision, narrowing down these candidates in each stage of the funnel" [@skyword_funnel]. The shape of the enrollment funnel suggests an institution that begins with a large pool of prospects they want to convert into customers, but at each successive stage the funnel narrows in order to convey the assumption of "melt" (e.g., only a subset of inquiries will submit applications). 

The practical purpose of the enrollment funnel is to inform interventions that increase the probability of "conversion" from one stage to another [@RN4322]. For example, emails and brochures encourage leads and inquiries to apply. Financial aid packages -- including institutional grant aid and guidance about federal grants and loans -- convert admits to enrolled students.

At the top of the enrollment funnel, universities identify "leads" by purchasing "student lists." The sum of purchased leads and student-as-first-contact inquiries (e.g., filled out an online admissions inquiry form) constitutes the set of all prospects the university has contact information for. Thus, student lists are the fundamental input for recruiting campaigns, which target individual prospects by mail, email, and on social media.

@RN4402 asked its clients to rate different "first contact" interventions (e.g., off-campus recruiting visit) as sources of inquiries and enrolled students. For the median public university, student list purchases were the highest source of inquiries, accounting for 26\% of inquiries, and accounted for 14\% of enrolled students, which ranked fourth after "application as first contact" (19\%), campus visit (17\%), and off-campus visit (16\%).

Although the federal government does not collect data about list buying behavior, we feel safe stating that the majority of BA granting public and private non-profit institutions purchase student lists annually. @RN4741 reported that 28\% of public universities purchased less than 50,000 names, 44\% purchased 50,000-100,000 names, 13\% purchased 100,000-150,000 names, and 15\% purchased more than 150,000 names.

## College Board and ACT

The largest student list vendors are College Board and ACT, which create student list products based on their database of test takers. College Board encourages test takers to opt into the "Student Search Service," which enables "accredited colleges, universities, nonprofit scholarship programs, and nonprofit educational organizations" [@cb_opt_in] to "license" their contact information. Similarly, ACT encourages students registering for the PreACT and ACT test to opt into the "Educational Opportunity Service" [@act_opt_in], which "provides accredited colleges and scholarship agencies with the names and contact information of students who opt in" [@RN4752, p. 1]. In fall 2021, the College Board Search and ACT Encoura student list products both charged \$0.50 per name [@RN0002]GET ACT CITE. 

What information do lists contain? Each purchased student list is essentially a spreadsheet that contains one row for each prospect that meets all criteria specified in the purchase. The columns of the student list include detailed contact information (name, address, email, cell phone) and detailed student characteristics derived from the pre-test questionnaire (e.g., ethnicity, race, gender, high school GPA, graduation year, high school code, intended major, first-generation status). The data template for an ACT student list can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rsP45OyOsnPYhV8uWYKDAy_spGhjj6aj/view) and the template for a College Board student list can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qvc_QRi9izEF1W78Lh4nNi5NsXjCZqUE/view). These fields represent a small subset of the information the testing agencies know about prospective students and contain little data about performance on assessments (e.g., SAT score).

How are purchased lists utilized? Student lists are the basic building block for recruiting campaigns -- spearheaded by in-house operations and/or enrollment management consultancies -- that use algorithms to inform recruiting interventions. However, both the algorithms and the interventions must be fed data about prospects (e.g., cannot send an email without an email address). Once purchased, student lists are layered with additional data sources, such as consumer data about prospects from credit companies, records of interactions with prospects (e.g., visiting virtual tour), historical application/enrollment data about students who attended the same high school, etc. These layered data are the input to predictive models that inform decisions about which recruiting interventions to send to which prospects (e.g., who gets a \$0.50 postcard and who gets a \$7 brochure). 

### Buying Lists from College Board and ACT

How do universities purchase student lists from College Board Student Search Service and ACT's Encoura platform? Each purchased list is a subset of prospects from the population of test-takers. Universities control which prospects are included in a particular list by specifying multiple search filters. @schmidt_2019 states that commonly specified search filters for ACT Encoura include high school graduation year, high school GPA, test score range (ACT or PreACT), gender, ethnicity, intended major, and geography (e.g., state, county, zip code) [@schmidt_2019]. As a hypothetical example, a university could purchase a student list from ACT that consisted of all prospects who scored between 30 and 34 on the ACT, have a GPA higher than 3.5, live in one of the top 10 metropolitan areas, and are in the high school senior class of 2023. 

A consequence of the high price charged per name by the College Board and ACT oligopoly is the incentive for "efficient" name buys, whereby universities only purchase the names of desirable prospects that are likely to apply and enroll. Over the past decade, the testing agencies have catered to this desire for efficiency by adding new search filters -- often based on statistical models -- that enable universities to target prospects with greater precision. ACT has moved more modestly in this direction, adding the "Enrollment Predictor" filter, which allows universities to filter prospects based on their predicted probability of enrolling. College Board has moved more aggressively, adding “geodemographic” filters that target prospects based the behavior of previous students at their high school or neighborood. We argue that geodemographic filters are efficient tools of exclusion that can – knowingly or unknowingly – result in racial redlining.

__Segment Analysis Service__. The College Board Segment Analysis Service (herein Segment) is an add-on to the Student Search Service that enables universities to filter prospects based on the college-going characteristics of the high schools prospects attend or the neighborhoods prospects live in. College Board markets Segment as "an Educationally Relevant Geodemographic Tagging Service." Now often referred to as "spatial big data," geodemography is a branch of market research that estimates the behavior of consumers based on where they live. @RN4565 states:

> The basic tenet of geodemography is that people with similar cultural backgrounds, means, and perspectives naturally gravitate toward one another or form relatively homogeneous communities; in other words, birds of a feather flock together. When they are living in a community, people\ldots share similar patterns of consumer behavior toward products, services, media, and promotions. The primary appeal of geodemography from the marketer's perspective is that, with just an address, s/he can begin to craft an image about a particular set of individuals based on the values, tastes, expectations, and behaviors associated with their geographic community (p. 1).

To create Segment, @RN4565 merged data about test-takers from College Board assessments and survey responses to data about their high school and neighborhood. Next, cluster analysis is used "to group the 33,000+ high schools and 44,000 neighborhoods into 29 unique high-school types and 33 unique neighborhood types referred to as clusters" [@RN4565, p. 4]. Thus, each neighborhood is assigned to one of 33 educational neighborhood (EN) clusters -- numbered EN:51-EN:83 -- and each high school is assigned to one of 29 high school (HS) clusters -- numbered HS:51-HS:79. 

A Segment customer may purchase a list that contains prospects who scored within a particular range on the SAT, who live in a particular set of metropolitan areas, and who are associated with particular combinations of neighborhood and high school cluster (e.g., live in neighborhood cluster "EN:61" and attend any high school OR live in neighborhood cluster "EN:73" and high school categories "HS:65" or "HS:70"). 

The problem is that Segment neighborhood and high school clusters are highly correlated with both racial and income demographics. For example, in the @RN4565 table of "Neighborhood cluster sample characteristics" (p. 4), neighborhood cluster "EN:61" is 30\% nonwhite and has median income of \$123,858 while neighborhood cluster "EN71" is 97% nonwhite and has median income of \$42,661. In the @RN4565 table of "High school cluster sample characteristics" (p. 5), high school cluster "HS:70" is 33\% nonwhite and has median income of \$105,721 while cluster "HS:71" is 98% nonwhite and has median income of \$43,391.

In Fall 2021, College Board added three new geodemographic filters to its basic Student Search Service product. The three "[Environmental Attributes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmTU9sb4ZiY)" filters are Travel Rates (out-of-state), Travel Rates (Distance from home), and AP engagement rates. For example, each high school is categorized as "low," "medium," or "high" in terms of the percentage of college students who attend an out-of-state university. In turn, a Student Search Service customer could purchase prospects who live in a particular metro area, with PSAT scores within some interval, and attend a high school with a "high" out-of-state travel rate. Like Segment, we are concerend that the Environmental attributes filters systematically exclude students who don't belong to the "right" kind of neighborhood or school.

## The Changing Market for Student List Data

Student lists are central to a surprisingly dynamic enrollment management industry. This section sketches the contours of the enrollment management ecosystem -- the technologies, who are the players and what do they want -- and describes recent shifts in the market for student list data.

Over the past 20 years, advances in technology that gave rise to the EdTech sector also yielded new sources of student list data, which created opportunities for entry by new firms and were also incorporated by existing players. In the 2000s, several upstart firms promised to compete with College Board and ACT student list products by creating college search engines, but many of these efforts failed. Mirroring trends in the broader EdTech sector, a surge of acquisitions has reshaped the student list business. As the test-optional movement gains momentum, PowerSchool -- a firm that sells information systems software to high schools -- and EAB -- an enrollment management consulting firm, have emerged as important suppliers of student list data. Meanwhile, College Board and ACT have leveraged their position in the student list business to enter the market for enrollment management consulting.

### Universities and Enrollment Management Consulting Firms

While primary customers of student list vendors are universities looking for students, we cannot understand the student list business without considering the role played by enrollment management consulting firms. As recruiting became more sophisticated and competitive over the past twenty years, a growing number of universities hire consultancies to develop and/or implement recruiting campaigns. Contributing to this trend, university leaders are often quick to fire senior enrollment and admissions professionals when enrollment does not meet targets. In turn, employee turnover reduces in-house capacity, making universities more dependent on external consultants.

While enrollment management consulting firms depend on universities as their primary source of revenue, these firms also depend on student list vendors for two reasons. First, making recommendations about student list purchases and executing these purchases are core services offered by most firms [E.G., CITE]. Second, names are an essential input to the predictive models and to the recruiting interventions (e.g., email, mail, social media) that the consultancies provide.

The market for enrollment management consulting consists of large firms providng the full range of enrollment services and smaller firms providing particular services. Anecdotally, the number of small and medium sized firms increased from 2000 to 2010, catalyzed by the growth of digital technologies and data science methodologies. Since 2010, the growing number of horizontal acquisitions has caused the market for enrollment management consulting to become more concentrated [@rogers_2018]. For example, RuffaloCODY acquired Noel-Levitz in 2014 [CITE](https://www.ruffalonl.com/about-ruffalo-noel-levitz/press-releases/ruffalocody-announces-merger-with-noel-levitz/) and EAB acquired the enrollment management business of Hobsons in 2021 [CITE]. Currently, the enrollment management consulting market consists of two large firms -- Ruffalo Noel Levitz, which claims to serve "1,900 campuses and nonprofits" each year [CITE](https://www.ruffalonl.com/about-ruffalo-noel-levitz/), and EAB, which claimed to serve "more than 1,100 higher education institutions" in 2021 [CITE](https://www.vistaequitypartners.com/spotlight/eab-school-communication-covid19/) -- and a shrinking number of small and mid-sized operations (e.g., [Fire Engine Red](https://www.fire-engine-red.com/), [Capture Higher Ed](https://www.capturehighered.com/)). Additionally, College Board and ACT have leveraged their position in the student list market to enter the enrollment management consulting market [@encoura_eduventures; @cbsearch_analytics], offering clients information about prospective students that is not included in purchased lists.

### Sources of Student List Data

Student list data are created by several different data generating processes. Prior to the 21st century, lists of college-going high school students were derived from two primary sources. First, student list data were generated by students completing standardized assessments (e.g., SAT, ACT, AP, GRE, TOEFL) developed by testing companies College Board, ACT, and ETS. Second, organizations like the National Research Center for College and University (NRCCUA) and College Bound Selection Service (CBSS) asked high school students to complete a survey during school hours.

Advances in technology yielded new sources of student list data in the 21st Century. One new source consists of survey data students voluntarily submit -- and the user data these sites collect -- to search engines and social network platforms that focus on college search. One subset of platforms (e.g., Cirkled In, Zinch) has the explicit goal of sharing profiles created by students with the universities the student expresses interest in attending. For example, Cirkled In's [website](https://www.cirkledin.com/) says "Go beyond test scores and connect directly to colleges. Cirkled In's portfolio platform showcases students' entire educational story." Another subset of platforms have the explicit goal of helping students identify "match" universities and scholarships (e.g., [myOptions](https://myoptions.org/students/), [Cappex](https://www.cappex.com/), and [Going Merry](https://www.goingmerry.com/)). Aside from the privacy policy page, these sites tend to avoid clear language about whether/how student data are shared. 

Both College Board and ACT have incorporated search engines into their student list products. College Board developed the college search website "[BigFuture](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/)." In 2021, College Board added the "[Interest in My College](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1DIfObi8w0)" search filter to Student Search Service, whereby universities can filter for prospects who expressed interest in their university when searching for colleges on [BigFuture](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/). ACT achieved similar ends by acquiring NRCCUA in 2018. Years earlier, NRCCUA had replaced the paper surveys that students filled out during school with an online college search engine named [myOptions](https://myoptions.org/). The ACT Encoura platform incorporates student list data derived from ACT assessments and data derived from the [myOptions](https://myoptions.org/) search engine.

A third set of student list data comes from software used by high schools and high school students. For example, [Naviance](https://www.powerschool.com/solutions/naviance-by-powerschool/) is a software purchased by high schools/districts that enables students to plan for college and enables guidance counselors to help students with the college search process. In turn, Naviance user data feeds into [Intersect](https://eab.com/intersect/), a software product that connects prospects to universities looking for students. Similarly, Scoir develops college search and application software for high school students and counselors [CITE](https://www.scoir.com/students-families?hsLang=en-us), while also enabling universities to message students that meet criteria specified by the university [CITE](https://www.scoir.com/colleges)

### EAB Enters the Student List Business

EAB is an enrollment management consulting firm that offers solutions for marketing and recruiting, financial aid and pricing, and student success. EAB does not sell student lists. Nevertheless, by the end of 2021, EAB arguably joined College Board and ACT as one of the three most important suppliers of student list data. Whereas any accredited institution can purchase names from College Board and ACT, only EAB clients have access to prospect databases controlled by EAB. How did this come to be? The story of how EAB entered the student list business is substantially a story about acquisitions.

The origins of EAB trace to 1983 when Bill Royall founded Royall \& Company to provide direct marketing and fundraising for political campaigns. By 1995, however, universities became the primary client. In 2015, the Advisory Board Company -- a technology and consulting company operating in the health sector -- purchased Royall \& Company for \$850 million as the centerpiece of its entrance into the higher education consulting market. In 2017, the Royall \& Company business line was sold to Vista Equity Partners for $1.5 billion and renamed EAB. Under Vista, the largest private equity firm in the world, EAB pursued vertical acquisitions that increased the value of existing activities and also leveraged relationships with other Vista subsidiaries. 


__YouVisit and Cappex__. A combination of acquisitions and partnerships positioned EAB to become a supplier of student names for EAB clients. In 2019, EAB acquired YouVisit, "the leading provider of virtual tour and interactive web content" [@eab_2019], thereby enhancing "EAB's ability to help colleges and universities find, engage, and enroll new students" (para.1).In September 2020 EAB announced the acquisition of Cappex, a college/scholarship search website reportedly used by 1.5 million students each year [@eab_2020].  Chris Marett, President of EAB Enrollment Services, said the acquisition "'will enable EAB partners to identify and engage prospective students who do not interact with schools through the traditional channels, such as campus visits or standardized tests. By expanding schools' inquiry pools, we can help institutions grow and diversify their student populations'"[@eab_2020, para.5].

The Cappex and YouVisit acquisitions complement existing EAB activities and complement each other. As fewer high school students take the SAT/ACT, Cappex represents a proprietary pool of prospects that cannot be purchased from College Board or ACT, and universities that wish to recruit these prospects must pay EAB for consulting and subscription services. EAB integrated YouVisit to create [EAB virtual tours](https://eab.com/products/virtual-tours/), which can be thought of as an "inquiry engine" because virtual tours record IP address, submitted contact information, and user behavior to help university clients know "who your visitors are and where their interests lie so that you can effectively recruit them" [CITE](https://eab.com/products/virtual-tours/). Furthermore, the Cappex and YouVisit acquisitions -- now fully integrated within the EAB platform -- are synergistic in that prospects searching for colleges on Cappex are served the virtual tours of EAB clients. Therefore, purchasing Cappex increases the value of the YouVisit virtual tour asset in that Cappex users are fed YouVisit virtual tours, which yield inquiries for clients that pay EAB for virtual tours.

__Hobsons and Naviance/Intersect__. In 2021, EAB and PowerSchool acquired and split the assets of Hobsons. Powerschool -- a subsidiary of Vista Equity Partners -- was founded with a focus on student information systems and is now the largest provider of software to K-12 education. Hobsons was a K-20 EdTech consulting firm and one of the largest providers of enrollment management consulting to universities. Hobsons also operated three software-as-service products: Naviance, college search/planning/application software sold to high schools; Intersect, a recruitment platform that connects universities to Naviance users; and, Starfish, a student success platform for colleges and universities. In the 2021 acquisition of Hobsons, PowerSchool acquired Naviance and Intersect for \$320 million and EAB acquired Starfish for \$90 million [@wan_2021]. EAB also took over Hobsons' consulting contracts with universities, increasing its share of the enrollment management consulting market. 

Following the acquisition, EAB announced a "reseller agreement" with PowerSchool "that makes EAB the exclusive provider of the Intersect student recruitment platform" [@eab_2021, para.2]. The agreement has a ten-year term and EAB paid PowerSchool \$32.4 million for the first year [@powerschool_ipo].

How does this reseller agreement position EAB as a supplier of student lists? Naviance, which is used by more than 10 million students and by 40% of US high schools [@powerschool], enables students to research potential colleges, request recommendations, submit transcripts and applications, etc. Intersect enables "colleges and universities to target students [Naviance users] with paid advertisements encouraging them to enroll"  [@markup_naviance]. Although Intersect customers (universities) do not receive the contact information of Naviance users, they control which Naviance users will receive recruiting messages by filtering on criteria such as geographic location, academic "ability," intended majors, and whether the student used Naviance to "research competitor institutions" [@markup_naviance]. Because EAB is the exclusive reseller of Intersect, universities cannot recruit Naviance users unless they become EAB clients. EAB promotional material states that Intersect is effective at funneling Naviance users to EAB clients [@eab_2021_2]. Given that that millions of high school students use Naviance each year to search for college and considering the decline in SAT/ACT test-takers, we reason that the reseller agreement will result in more clients for EAB.

# Policy Concerns {#concerns}

We consider policy concerns and solutions in relation to the ideal of equality of opportunity in college access, the idea that all students should have the opportunity to attend a high-quality college or university, regardless of race, gender, creed, parental education, household income, or where they live.

The surprising importance of student lists for college access in the U.S. is a consequence of the interaction between federal policy and the market for higher education. Federal higher education policy provides funding to students but depends on Title IV institutions to provide access. The idea is, since federal funding follows the students, institutions have an incentive to go out and find the students. But institutions don't know who the prospective students are or how to contact them. This is the problem that student lists solve. In the enrollment funnel, the recruiting process begins by buying the contact information of "leads" from College Board, ACT, and other vendors. Research strongly suggests that student lists have large effects on college access outcomes [@RN4739; @RN4752], particularly for first-generation students and students from historically underserved racial and ethnic groups.

Unfortunately, the student list business undermines equality of opportunity for students because of several reasons. An overarching reason is that student list products are oriented to the enrollment goals of universities rather than the opportunity goals of students because universities are the paying customers. This explanation suggests that the underlying policy problem is university enrollment preferences, not student lists. To a certain extent -- and for certain institutions -- this is true; if a university only wants to enroll wealthy students, regulating the student list business will not compel the university to enroll poor students. That said, the choices universities make about which names to purchase are structured by the architecture of student list products -- which prospects are included in the product, the targeting behaviors allowed by the product, the targeting behaviors encouraged by the product.

The search filters on College Board and ACT student list products facilitate the exclusion of prospective students. For example, universities often search for STEM majors by filtering on AP exam scores, but which students attend high schools with widespread access to AP classes? Geographic filters (e.g., buy prospects in particular zip codes) often conflict with the ideal that educational opportunity should not depend on where you live. Filtering at the zip code level is dangerous because zip codes are highly correlated with race. Filtering for particular metropolitan areas is dangerous because what about students who live outside the metropolitan area? College Board geodemographic filters are particularly problematic because they filter at the high school and Census tract level and because they filter students based on the behavior of former students from that school/neighborhood rather than the achievement of the prospect.

Another source of exclusion is which prospects are included in the underlying database. College Board and ACT student list products exclude students who do not take College Board or ACT assessments. Test-taking rates have differed by race and by class since 1972 [@RN2275] -- when College Board created the Student Search Service -- yielding racial and socioeconomic inequality in which prospects are contacted by universities. As test-optional becomes the new normal, the number of SAT/ACT test-takers will decline dramatically, and in ways that may be correlated with race, class, and geography. Because College Board and ACT lists are a fundamental mechanism of college access in the U.S., the eroding coverage of these lists may trigger a crisis in college access because universities will not know who the prospective students are or how to contact them.

In (micro-economics) theory, market entry by new student list vendors will overcome the problem of eroding coverage by College Board and ACT lists. This perspective is based on the idea that competitive markets are generally better for consumers than oligopolies. We fear that, without significant government intervention, the death of the SAT/ACT exam will hurl student list market into a Game of Thrones style "war of all against all" [@RN1403] that negatively affects college access. The reasoning behind our skepticism is four-fold; first, we doubt that these new entrants will achieve -- even in aggregate -- the coverage achieved by College Board/ACT prior to test optional; second, with so many student list vendors, universities will be confused about which vendors have data for which prospects; third, large suppliers (e.g., PowerSchool, EAB) will attempt to recreate oligopoly conditions; and, fourth, large suppliers have learned to maximize profit not by selling names to any university but by restricting access to universities that pay for expensive subscription or consulting services.

# Regulating the Student List Business {#regulation}

Having laid out the policy concerns, how should federal policymakers think aout regulating the student list business? Industries are regulated by laws that prescribe rules and by regulatory agencies that enforce those laws. In its present form, the Higher Education Act (HEA) -- enforced by the U.S. Department of Education -- is incapable of regulating the student list business. However, laws enforced by other regulatory agencies may be relevant to particular aspects of the student list business. Our goal is to start the conversation about federal regulation. We believe this conversation should be approached in three buckets: regulating student list products; regulating student list suppliers; and regulating student list customers.


## Regulating Products

Federal policymakers have become increasingly concerned about products that utilize "big data," "artificial intelligence," "algorithms," and "predictive analytics," citing research findings that "apparently 'neutral' technology can produce troubling outcomes -- including discrimination by race or other legally protected classes" [@RN4749, para.1]. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has authority over commercial products and is viewed as the federal regulatory agency most responsible for addressing these concerns. FTC concerns and guidelines on these issues emerged over the past decade following several reports and hearings [e.g., @RN4746; @RN4744; @RN4743; @RN4748; @RN4749; @ftc_2019]. We highlight two reports in particular, _Data Brokers: A Call for Transparency and Accountability_ [@RN4744] and _Big Data: A Tool for Inclusion or Exclusion?_ [@RN4743].

@RN4744 defines "data brokers" as "companies that collect consumers' personal information and resell or share that information with others" [@RN4744, p. i]. @RN4744 distinguished between three categories of data brokers: (1) "consumer reporting agencies" covered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA); (2) entities that sell consumer data for marketing purposes (which would include entities that sell student lists); and (3) entities not covered by FCRA that use consumer data for non-marketing purposes, such as fraud detection. 

Marketing data brokers sell consumer data to businesses looking for customers. Typically, products sold by marketing data brokers enable businesses to buy data about some customers but not others. A common approach is to categorize customers into different "segments." For example, one marketing data broker analyzed by @RN4744 developed the category "Married Sophisticates" which consists of "upper-middle class [couples] \ldots with no children" and the category "Rural Everlasting" which consists of single people older than 66 with "low educational attainment and low net worth" [@RN4744, p.20]. The College Board Segment Analysis Service product adopts a similar approach when it categorizes every high school into one of 29 types and categorizes every neighborhood into one of 33 types [@RN4565]. Another common practice by marketing data brokers is assigning scores to customers based on their likelihood of making a purchase or responding to a marketing intervention [@RN4744]. An example of this approach is the "Enrollment Predictor" prospect search filter in ACT's Encoura student list product, which enables universities to filter prospects based on the predicted probability they will enroll [@schmidt_2019].

PX: PARAGRAPH SUMMARIZING FTC 2016 
@RN4743 described policy concerns about the usage of marketing products sold by data brokers. Broadly, policymakers are concerned that these technologies may be used to "categorize consumers in ways that can result in exclusion of certain populations" [@RN4743, p.9]. For example, "if big data analytics incorrectly predicts that particular consumers are not likely to respond\ldots [or] are not good candidates for prime credit offers, educational opportunities, or certain lucrative jobs, such educational opportunities, employment, and credit may never be offered to these consumers" [@RN4743, p. 2]. Additionally, @RN4743 raised concerns that these products cause individuals to be denied opportunities based on the actions of others and that these products create new justifications for exclusion (e.g., excluding customers based on data gleaned from social media accounts).
