# How could lists be so important?
## The US market for higher education


Title IV institutions
- Allowed to enroll students that receive federal financial aid

<br>

A national voucher system
- Federal/state student aid, household savings follow students to institutions

<br>

Tuition is largest revenue source
- Title IV institutions have incentive to enroll students who receive federal student aid

<br>

Problems
- Students don't know all their options, don't know which institutions interested in them
- Institutions don't know who the prospects are or how to contact them

<br>

Student lists
- A matchmaking intermediary that connects institutions to prospects

# The student list project


--- .subsubsection

# Project overview 
## &nbsp;

Data collection

- Issued public records requests to all public universities in four states (CA, IL, MN, TX)
- Target student list vendors
  - College Board, ACT
- Data collection began February 2020  
  - Seeking student lists purchased from 2016-2020

<br>
For each purchased list, sought two pieces of data

1. "Order summary" specifying search filter criteria ([LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gPZ-WWw0gdFT7VtzBN3hKLnj2DzoaqnY/view))
1. De-identified prospect-level student list ([LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qvc_QRi9izEF1W78Lh4nNi5NsXjCZqUE/view))

<br>
Empirical research questions

1. Which filter criteria were selected in student lists purchases?
1. What are the characteristics of prospects included in student lists purchases?
1. What is the relationship between student list filter criteria and the characteristics of
purchased prospects?

<br>
Partners

- Funded by Joyce Foundation, Kresge Foundation
- Pro bono partnership with a civil rights legal organization and four multinational law firms
- Our first report to be published by [ACCEPT](https://www.acceptgroup.org/)

# What we learned
## &nbsp;

Began the project with a focus on university behavior

- Which universities doing a "good" vs. "bad" job of reaching out to the community?
- This was the wrong focus!

<br>
What we learned
- The student list products themselves are problematic
- Often, name buys outsourced to consultancy and university employees lacked knowledge
- Radical transformation in market for student list data happening right now

<br>
Revised focus
- Student list products
- Key players in the market for student list data

# Student List Business/Market Dynamics


--- .subsection

# Situating the student list business


--- .subsubsection

# How industries find customers
## List-based and behavioral-based leads

"Lead generation" 

- Connect consumers interested in products (leads) to merchants who sell those products `r citep(bib['ftc2016'])`

<br>
__List-based leads__, based on the direct mail model

- "Publisher" obtains information about customers >>
  - Often, publisher sells data to "aggregator" >>
  - Publisher/aggregator sells data to merchant >>
  - Merchant serves marketing material to consumers via purchased contact info
- Student lists are example of list-based lead generation

<br>
__Behavioral-based leads__ (e.g., Google Search)

- Target (*verb*) users of a platform (e.g., Twitter)
- Identify targets (*noun*) based on user profile, simultaneously serve ads while they are on platform
  - Also, serve ads when they visit website that partners with the platform (e.g., Google Display Network)


<br>
Finding customers in higher education

- Buy lists from College Board and ACT to identify college-bound high school students `r citep(bib['RN4728'])`
- Behavioral based marketing to target markets where reliable student lists are unavailable
  - e.g., programs offered by community colleges and for-profits, online program managers (OPMs) recruiting adults
  - Additionally, behavioral based marketing for brand awareness

# The enrollment funnel
## &nbsp;

<br>

Prospects

- Population of desirable potential students

Leads

- Prospects whose contact info has been obtained

Inquiries

- Prospects who have contacted the institution
  - Institution as first contact (leads)
  - Student as first contact

<br>
Interventions along the funnel

- Convert prospects to leads
  - purchase student lists
- Convert leads/inquiries to applicants
  - Email, mail, targeted social media
- Convert admits to enrolles
  - Financial aid packages

# College Board and ACT lists

--- .subsubsection

# Standardized testing
## &nbsp;

College Board and ACT have been largest student list vendors for several decades

- College Board "Student Search Service" created in 1972 `r citep(bib['belkin2019-studata'])`
- ACT "Educational Opportunity Service"
  - ACT acquired National Research Center for College and University (NRCCUA) in 2018
  - Student list products part of new "Encoura Data Lab"

<br>
Source of student list data

- Create student list data from database of test takers (e.g., PSAT, SAT, AP, PreACT, ACT)
  - Pre-test questionnaire (e.g., demographic, preferences about college)
- Students have opportunity to opt in or opt out of student list products

<br>
What information does a list contain
- Contact, demographic, college preferences, limited academic achievement
- College Board template [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qvc_QRi9izEF1W78Lh4nNi5NsXjCZqUE/view)
- ACT template [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rsP45OyOsnPYhV8uWYKDAy_spGhjj6aj/view)


--- .subsubsection

# Sources of exclusion
## &nbsp;

College Board and ACT student lists exclude students in two broad ways

1. Generally, only test-takers are included in student list products
  - Test-taking rates differ by race, socioeconomic status, geography
1. "Search filters" allow universities to control which prospects included/excluded from a purchase

<br>
Test-optional

- Test-optional movement threatens "coverage" of College Board/ACT student list products
- Number of test-takers will likely decline in future


--- .subsubsection

# Buying student lists
## &nbsp;

"Search filters" allow universities to control which prospects included/excluded from a purchase

<br>
Commonly used search filters ([Link to ACT filters](https://helpcenter.encoura.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035260452-Prospect-Search-Filters-))

- Graduation year, HS GPA, test score range, gender, race/ethnicity, geography (e.g., state, zip-code, "geomarket"), intended major

<br>

Recent trend towards search filters based on predictive analytics

- College Board "geodemographic" filters
  - Target prospects based on historical college-going behavior of students at the school/neighborhood
- ACT "enrollment predictor"
  - Target prospects based on their predicted probability of enrolling at your institution

<br>

Policy concerns

- Some search filters disproportionately exclude underrepresented students, especially when used in combination
- Filtering prospects based on the behavior of others (e.g., geodemographic filters)

# Market dynamics


--- .subsubsection

# Five dynamics shaping the market for student list data
## &nbsp;

1. Universities and enrollment management (EM) consulting firms
  - Universities are primary customers of student lists, but EM consultancies play central role in process
1. New data sources, new vendors
  - Advances in technology created new sources of student list data, leading to market entry by new vendors
1. Acquisitions and concentration
  - Trend towards competition reversed by rise in acquisitions; EAB enters the student list business
1. Incumbents College Board and ACT seek to retain competitive advantage
  - Add product features that aid micro-targeting
  - Enter the market for enrollment management consulting
1. The test-optional movement
  - For-profit firms poised to acquire market share ceded by CB/ACT, and maximize profit by restricting access to names


--- .subsubsection

# Universities and consulting firms
## TEXT

Universities need students

- Universities are the primary customers of student list products
- As recruiting became more complex and competitive, universities hire EM consultancies to develop/implement recruiting campaigns

<br>
Enrollment management (EM) consulting firms
- Universities are the primary customers of EM consultancies
- EM firms depend on student list suppliers for two reasons:
  1. Advice/execution of name buys is a core service offered by firms
  1. Names are essential input to predictive models and recruiting interventions firms provide

<br>
Competition in the enrollment management consulting industry

- A mix of large full-service providers (e.g., RNL) and small/medium boutique firms
- Anecdotally, market entry in the 2000s
- Over last decade, increase in market concentration due to acquisitions `r citep(bib[c('rogers_2014','wan_2021')])`
