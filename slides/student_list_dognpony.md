# How could lists be so important?
## The US market for higher education


Title IV institutions
- Allowed to enroll students that receive federal financial aid

<br>

A national voucher system
- Federal/state student aid, household savings follow students to institutions

<br>

Tuition is largest revenue source
- Title IV institutions have incentive to enroll students who receive federal student aid

<br>

Problems
- Students don't know all their options, don't know which institutions interested in them
- Institutions don't know who the prospects are or how to contact them

<br>

Student lists
- A matchmaking intermediary that connects institutions to prospects

# The student list project
## Project overview

Data collection

- Issued public records requests to all public universities in four states (CA, IL, MN, TX)
- Target student list vendors
  - College Board, ACT
- Data collection began February 2020  
  - Seeking student lists purchased from 2016-2020

<br>
For each purchased list, sought two pieces of data

1. "Order summary" specifying search filter criteria [LINK]
1. De-identified prospect-level student list [LINK]

<br>
Empirical research questions

1. Which filter criteria were selected in student lists purchases?
1. What are the characteristics of prospects included in student lists purchases?
1. What is the relationship between student list filter criteria and the characteristics of
purchased prospects?

<br>
Partners

- Funded by Joyce Foundation, Kresge Foundation
- Pro bono partnership with a civil rights legal organization and four multinational law firms
- Our first report to be published by [ACCEPT](https://www.acceptgroup.org/)

# The student list project
## What we learned

Began the project with a focus on university behavior

- Which universities doing a "good" vs. "bad" job of reaching out to the community?
- This was the wrong focus!

<br>
What we learned
- The student list products themselves are problematic
- Often, name buys outsourced to consultancy and university employees lacked knowledge
- Radical transformation in market for student list data happening right now

<br>
Revised focus
- Student list products
- Key players in the market for student list data

# How industries find customers
## List-based and behavioral-based leads

"Lead generation" 

- Connect consumers interested in products (leads) to merchants who sell those products (Federal Trade Commission, 2016)

<br>
__List-based leads__, based on the direct mail model

- "Publisher" obtains information about customers >>
  - Often, publisher sells data to "aggregator" >>
  - Publisher/aggregator sells data to merchant >>
  - Merchant serves marketing material to consumers via purchased contact info
- Student lists are example of list-based lead generation

<br>
__Behavioral-based leads__ (e.g., Google Search)

- Target (*verb*) users of a platform (e.g., Twitter)
- Identify targets (*noun*) based on user profile, simultaneously serve ads while they are on platform
  - Also, serve ads when they visit website that partners with the platform (e.g., Google Display Network)


<br>
Finding customers in higher education

- Buy lists from College Board and ACT to identify college-bound high school students (EAB, 2018)
- Behavioral based marketing to target markets where reliable student lists are unavailable
  - e.g., programs offered by community colleges and for-profits, online program managers (OPMs) recruiting adults
  - Additionally, behavioral based marketing for brand awareness
